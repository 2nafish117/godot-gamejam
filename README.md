# üß™ Features

## üåå Game Settings

This template project comes with game settings out of the box:

- **Audio volume** (Master, Sound, Music)
- **Screen Resolution**
- **Window Mode** (Windowed, Borderless, Fullscreen)
- **V-Sync**
- **Game Language** (English only by default)

## ‚ú® Bootsplash scene support

Either use the default Godot bootsplash or define your own logo bootsplashes!

## üé© Basic menu flow (main menu, settings, pause)

This project comes with basic menu navigation that allows you to navigate between ingame, settings and quitting the game.

## üíæ Save Game Integration

Automatically saves the state of the game on exit. Starting a new game overrides the existing save game. Any game object that needs to be saved has to be part of the "Persist" group.

## üåé Translation support (i18n)

Comes with pre-defined translations that can be extended.

## _üöÄ Automatic [itch.io](https://itch.io) deployment_ (coming soon!)

Create a release branch and merge your Git commits into it. Via Github Actions, your game will be automatically deployed to itch.io! For more information, [read this guide](https://bitbra.in/2020/08/01/publish-godot-game-to-itchio.html).

> **‚ö† This is not yet supported until Godot reaches Release Candidate status!**
